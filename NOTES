Seems like cmd vel is actually just one command rather than
sending a command for a duration.
just we need to map each command -> action

Also, we actually need two points to localize properly
I'm thinking a particle filter seems easier even if I have no idea how to implement it

the thing about one observation is that we can only infer x,y coordinates if we know theta... but theta is part of the state too, I'm thinking I'm not making sense
but we definitely need two points to localize
