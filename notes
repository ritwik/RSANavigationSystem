Needed:
    - Movement messages which go from the Drive to KFilter - added
        - fwd
        - phi
    - State messages - added
        - x global
        - y global
        - theta
    - Message between Main and PathPlanning
        - Don't know yet
        - Could be simple
        - Could be complicated

Error:
    - Observations

    - Actions
        - Forward
            - Make it go 4 metres
            - Time how long it takes
            - Do this 5 times
            - Average
            - Find variance
            - Based on that figure out error in DISTANCE
            - Repeat for other distances
            - Plot to figure out which is the constant error, which is where the line intersects with the y-axis
        - Turn
            - Similar to the above
            - May

Values:
    - 0.5 is the max vel
        - probably metres/sec
    

going at 0.5 cmd_vel for 1.5s -> 69 +- 2
0.4 -> 56
0.25 -> 33 (we had an outlier of 28)
0.3 -> 41
0.07 -> 8/9
0.05 -> 5.5
reset button thing


turns

0.5 -> ~45 !
1 -> ~90

without times
