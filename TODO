So we have:
- Working beacon detection
- Working kalman filter (? - needs more testing)
- Working path planner (? - needs more testing)
- Partly tested drive/controller code

For tomorrow we need to:
- Get that drive working for arbitrary paths we feed it for testing
- Get the path planner to plan from a given point on the robot and see what that plan is (test that it is good)
- Consider how to determine whether it is worth pursuing a point further at any given time (as opposed to dropping it and going for the next point)
- Planning what we'll do at the very start
- Test the full system. 
- Writing a script to start the entire system in one line (is this written already?)

We'll be in the lab from 9(ish) and Aditya and I will be there most of the day (+/- a few hours to work on other assignments).

Let's
- get to the lab and work on some of this
- figure out how we're going at 11am and reconsider what we need to focus on / get done
